# Cassava-Leaf-detection-kaggle-competition
Cassava Leaf detection kaggle competition notebook

I made this Notebook for the kaggle competition of cassava leaf disease detection.

As the name suggest was the competition was about predecting the disease of the leaf from its image.

For this notebook I used Keras in frontend and tensflow 2.0 in backend to increase the processing speed and accuracy of model,for training I used online NVidia K80 GPU which is provided by kaggle.

the training dataset consist of 21397 images and used EfficientNetB0 for transfer learning but I used my pretrained weights for training of the model.

As the notebook is in my kaggle account , to take a look at notebook please click on the below given link. Thank you.
